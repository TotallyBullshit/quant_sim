Quantistician
=====

Provides
  1. An algorithmic trading library for quants, traders, researchers alike
  2. A statistics library to be used in algorithm performance tracking

How to use the documentation
----------------------------
Documentation is available in two forms: docstrings provided
with the code, and a loose standing reference guide, available from
`the Quantistician homepage <http://www.githubt.com/lanj88/quant>`_.

We recommend exploring the docstrings using
`IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org>`_, an advanced Python shell with
TAB-completion and introspection capabilities.  See below for further
instructions.

The docstring examples assume that `quantistician` has been imported as `quant`::

  >>> import quantistician as quant

Code snippets are indicated by three greater-than signs::

  >>> start_dt = datetime.datetime(2003,01,01)
  >>> end_dt = datetime.datetime(2013,01,01)

Use the built-in ``help`` function to view a function's docstring::

  >>> help(quant.algorithm)
  ... # doctest: +SKIP

For some objects, ``np.info(obj)`` may provide additional help.  This is
particularly true if you see the line "Help on ufunc object:" at the top
of the help() page.  Ufuncs are implemented in C, not Python, for speed.
The native Python help() does not know how to view their help, but our
np.info() function does.

To search for documents containing a keyword, do::

  >>> np.lookfor('keyword')
  ... # doctest: +SKIP

General-purpose documents like a glossary and help on the basic concepts
of numpy are available under the ``doc`` sub-module::

  >>> from numpy import doc
  >>> help(doc)
  ... # doctest: +SKIP

Viewing documentation using IPython
-----------------------------------
Start IPython with the NumPy profile (``ipython -p numpy``), which will
import `numpy` under the alias `np`.  Then, use the ``cpaste`` command to
paste examples into the shell.  To see which functions are available in
`numpy`, type ``np.<TAB>`` (where ``<TAB>`` refers to the TAB key), or use
``np.*cos*?<ENTER>`` (where ``<ENTER>`` refers to the ENTER key) to narrow
down the list.  To view the docstring for a function, use
``np.cos?<ENTER>`` (to view the docstring) and ``np.cos??<ENTER>`` (to view
the source code).

Copies vs. in-place operation
-----------------------------
Most of the functions in `numpy` return a copy of the array argument
(e.g., `np.sort`).  In-place versions of these functions are often
available as array methods, i.e. ``x = np.array([1,2,3]); x.sort()``.
Exceptions to this rule are documented.
